# Database Schema Design

## What is a DBMS

To manage digital databases we use specialized software called Database Management Systems (DBMS). These systems typically run on servers and are managed by Database Administrators (DBAs).

In less technical terms, we need a type of software that will allow us to create, access, and generally manage our databases. In the world of relational databases, we specifically use Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMs). Some examples are Postgres, SQLite, MySQL, and Oracle.

Choosing a DBMS determines everything from how you set up your database, to where and how the data is stored, to what SQL commands you can use. Most systems share the core of the SQL language that we've learned.

In other words, you can expect **SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, WHERE** and the like to be the same across all DBMSs, but the subtleties of the language may vary.

## What is SQLite?

SQLite is the DBMS that will be used in this module. It is more of a lightweight system and thus easier to setup than some others.

SQLite is not a database (like relational, graph, or document are databases) but rather a database management system.

## Opening an existing database in SQLite Studio

One useful visual interface we might use with a SQLite database is called SQLite Studio

Once installed, we can use it to open any .db3 file and view the tables, data, and even make changes in the database.

## Database Schema

A database schema is the shape of our database. It defines what tables we'll have, which columns should exist within the tables and any restriction son each column.

A well-designed database schema keeps the data well organized and can help ensure high quality data.

Note that while schema design is usually left to the Database Administrators, understanding schema helps when designing APIs and database logic. And in a smaller team, this step may fall on the developer.

## Follow along: Schema Design

When designing a single table, we need to ask three things:

* What fields (or columns) are present?
* What type of data do we expect for each field?
* Are there other restrictions needed for each column?

Looking at the following schema diagram for an accounts table, we can answer those questions.

| field | datatype | metadata |
| --------|---------------|
|id | unsigned integer | primary key, auto increments, generated by database |
| name | string | required, unique |
|budget | numeric | required |
