# The Reducer Pattern

The difficulties of storing and efficiently performing logic on data within components become more and more apparent as the amount of data increases. Consequently, as components grow and deal with large sets of data, the storing and transportation of state across the entire application increasingly becomes more and more cumbersome as well. Reducers offer one possible way to address this problem within the component. At the level of the application, an elegant combination of Context API with reducers provides one possible way that React developers can manage global state.

## Redux

Redux is a very sophisticated UI - Component Library that can be used together with a few other libraries to build out large scale Single Page Applications. But as our Applications scale in size so too will the data that we are concerned with within our applications. And you can only start to imagine how difficult it might be to manage all of that data inside of React components. Redux is a library that can help solve this problem by providing a single source of truth for our data within our application. As your team grows, and as your application scales, Redux can help offset the pains that can be brought on as a result of complexity.
