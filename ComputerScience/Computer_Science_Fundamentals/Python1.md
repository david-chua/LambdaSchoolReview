# Python 1

## Overview

Many times you are working through the computer science curriculum, and when you are on the job, you will find yourself faced with large, challenging problems. There are strategies we can use to break these problems down into more manageable pieces.

"The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. Problem-solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem solving skills".
- Allen B Downey.

Every problem, large or small, can be broken into smaller chunks. Logically, if you take a seemingly unsolvable problem and break it into smaller, more manageable chunks, once you've finished solving each piece of the problem, you'll have conquered the whole thing.

Through the Computer Science curriculum, we will reference and draw from the Lambda Problem Solving Framework, sometimes referred to as **UPER**. This framework is a step-by-step process:

1. **U**understand
2. **P**lan
3. **E**xecute
4. **R**eflect

Almost all problems are a series of sub-problems. You will use the steps of **U.P.E.R** on the primary outer problem and the inner, individual sub-problems.

## 1. Understand

Before doing anything else, make sure you understand precisely what the problem is asking. A helpful starting point could be transcribing the technical description of the problem into your own words.

### Questions

Here is a list of starting questions that might come up during this step:

* What are the inputs your code receives?
  * What is the range of the input?
  * How big can the input be (how much data)?

* What are the outputs your code produce?
  * What is the range of the output?
  * How big can the output be (how much data)?

* How performant must the code be?
* Is there anything missing from the task description that needs to be clarified?
* What assumptions are you making?
  * Does anyone else on the team need to validate these assumptions?

### Actions

The most important thing you can do during this stage of the process is to **ask questions**. Be as specific as you can when you ask questions. Be clear and concise with your questions by using unambiguous language and only including necessary details.

Don't be afraid of this part of the process - enjoy it. Look at the problem with curiosity to be explored, not just something there to torment you. Feeling frustrated and afraid won't help you at work or in an interview. Remember, problem-solving is part of the fun, so enjoy it.

One approach is to identify the smaller components that make up the larger problem. If you get stuck in understanding, break the larger problem into smaller sub-problems. Then, apply this framework against each other of the smaller sub-problems until you solve the larger problem.

Try to digest the problem and comprehend it by rewriting the problem in your own words. If you had to describe it to someone else, how would you do it?

Diagram how the data flows through the problem. Think about each stage of the journey for the data. What will happen to it as it travels from one step to another?

Think like a villain. What inputs would break your program?

Where is the description of the problem incomplete? If you cannot get answers on something that the specifications leave unclear, make an educated guess, and document your assumptions and decision.

You are done with this step when you can explain this problem to someone who has never seen it. Your explanation should be thorough enough for this person to skip the "Understand" step and start planning right away.
