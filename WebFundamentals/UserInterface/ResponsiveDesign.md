# Responsive Design

Responsive design covers topics that range from fixed layouts to fully responsive websites. Responsive design addresses accessibility challenges and how developers can use flexible units to overcome them. On top of being accessible, fully responsive websites are a joy to use and push web development forward.

## Responsive Web Design layouts

### Fixed Layout

Fixed layouts are what the early web looked like. Designs usually looked good on desktop screens but would slowly get worse as the browser's viewport got smaller and smaller.

Horizontal scroll bars were a normal feature and you would find yourself pinching and zooming all over mobile devices to read a website.

User experience is usually poor.

Features of Fixed Layout:

* Design is usually desktop only
* CSS widths are usually hardcoded pixels
* Horizontal scroll bars appear as the viewport shrinks smaller than the website's design
* No media queries are used
* Quicker deployment.


### Fluid Layout

Opposite of a fixed layout is one that could expand and contract in proportion to most devices. This sounds great at first, but without constraints, you soon have to think about how your site will look on several devices with one set of styles.

Some of the problems of a fluid layout include
* images getting too small
* buttons growing too large
* layouts that grow to be way too spacious for desktops.

Fluid Layout Features:

* Design is often divided among desktop, tablet, or phone.
* Percent based units instead of hardcoded pixels.
* Everything is designed to proportionally shrink
* No media queries are used.

### Adaptive Layout
