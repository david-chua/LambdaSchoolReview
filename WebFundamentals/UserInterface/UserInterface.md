## What is HTML?

- HTML is one of the languages used for web development. It is a "markup language" as opposed to "programming languages" like JavaScript, Java, Python, etc.
- It is specifically designed to display data in a graphical form rather than to execute tasks.
- HTML was created as a language when the first visual web browsers came into existence in the early 90's. It is read by browser and then used as a blueprint for displaying information on your screen.
